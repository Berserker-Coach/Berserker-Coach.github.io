<p>>h1>General guidelines for performance-enhancing eating and, where applicable, sensible body fat loss</h1>
</p>
<p>Under NO circumstances should an athlete, especially an adolescent athlete,  trying to lower their body fat % engage in: starvation dieting, lengthy severe calorie restriction, or unusually restrictive food choices (i.e. “I only eat grapefruit.”)
</p>
<p>Note:  None of the advice below will work as effectively, or at all, if you are not getting enough sleep.  Sleep at least 8 hours a day!
</p>
<p>Here are some very high-level general guidelines and suggested food choices for being a high-performing athlete.  They apply whether or not you are attempting to lose body fat.  Please feel free to discuss these with the coaches for more nuance.
</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with your body composition, simply stay hydrated and eat when you are hungry, until you are no longer hungry.  Do not eat if you are not hungry.
</p>
<p>If you are trying to become leaner/gain muscle for performance reasons, keep in mind that this should not be a drastic, unpleasant, or unusual process.  Your health is and always should be your primary concern.  Performance is second, and your weight/ body composition a distant third.
</p>
<p>When losing weight, an easy way to self-limit is to strive for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_hachi_bun_me">Hara hachi bun me</a>” at meals.
</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism">Confucian</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_hachi_bun_me#cite_note-2">[2]</a> teaching that instructs people to eat until they are 80 percent full.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_hachi_bun_me#cite_note-Okinawa-3">[3]</a> Roughly, in English, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"> Japanese</a> phrase translates to, “Eat until you are eight parts (out of ten) full”<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_hachi_bun_me#cite_note-Okinawa-3">[3]</a> or “belly 80 percent full”.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_hachi_bun_me#cite_note-Grossman-4">[4]</a>
</p>
<p>For a good intuitive rule of thumb, practically speaking, if you wouldn’t want to eat some plain cooked meat, like a grilled chicken breast (or something like a spiced baked potato, for vegetarians) if it was in front of you,  you aren’t actually hungry.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1>Hydration</h1></li>
</ul>
<p>Always stay adequately hydrated. That doesn’t mean force yourself to drink.  It means drink to satisfy your thirst, and maybe a bit extra.  If you are in the bathroom and unable to urinate even a little bit, or your urine is dark yellow colored, you need to drink some water!
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Strive to limit what you drink to water and unsweetened flavored beverages, like seltzer or fruit teas)</li>
	<li>Milk ( if you can drink milk) is fine.
	<ul>
		<li>Treat whole milk as if it is food, not a beverage.  Grass-fed milk whenever possible.</li>
		<li>Skim milk is more of a hydrating drink, (though still a food) and its provenance is less critical.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Drink caffeinated beverages not at all or in moderation ( e.g., coffee, tea, yerba mate). Try to treat them like taking medicine - that is, use the caffeine on purpose and for a specific and time-limited reason, not as part of a daily lifestyle.</li>
	<li>Avoid whenever possible (= always)  artificially sweetened drinks (E.g., Crystal Light, Diet Coke, Vitamin Water Zero, diet sodas, etc.  They will quite literally confuse your brain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1>Protein</h1></li>
</ul>
<p>Eat adequate quantities of high-quality protein, ideally daily, and maybe even every meal, although this is less critical.
</p>
<p>“Adequate” for a hard-working athlete typically means between 0.5 and 1.0 g of protein / lb of body weight per day.  Find a number that works well for you.  More protein than this is not a problem, but is unnecessary.  Less is also not a problem but will make regulating blood sugar a little harder.  The harder you are training, the more protein you need, up to that 1g/1lb number.   If you are calorie restricting to lose body weight, you should eat a higher percentage of your daily calories as protein in order to maintain muscle mass as you lose weight.
</p>
<p>Primary protein sources may  include, among others
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chicken </li>
	<li>Turkey (& other poultry)</li>
	<li>Fish  (especially cold-water fish like salmon)</li>
	<li>Eggs</li>
	<li>Beef, especially lean beef</li>
	<li>Milk / plain yogurt [see above for milk = food]</li>
	<li>Other meats generally.
	<ul>
		<li>(minimize heavily processed meats like chicken nuggets)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>There is NO need for protein powders or supplements other than convenience, e.g., when traveling, first thing in the morning, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vegetarians and especially vegans have to look a little harder and further for protein (and B12) - talk to the coaches for more details.
</p>
<p>Vegetarian/Vegan sources of protein include
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Beans</li>
	<li>Pulses (e.g. lentils,)</li>
	<li>Nuts ( also a source of quality fat, sometimes of carbs)</li>
	<li>Soy</li>
	<li>High-protein grains and seeds (e.g., chia, hemp, quinoa, triticale)</li>
	<li>Various vegetable (e.g. peas)</li>
	<li>Vegetarian/vegan protein powders (an exception to the powder guidelines)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If eating vegan, make sure to consume complete proteins, and vary sources as much as possible, as well as making sure to consume adequate Vitamin B12 and essential fats.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1>Carbohydrates</h1></li>
</ul>
<p>Look to get carbs in the form of fruits, vegetables and leafy greens if possible.
</p>
<p>Getting approximately 40% of your daily calories from carbs is a good place to start, but this is not a magical number.
</p>
<p>Seek out high(er)-fiber carbs whenever possible.
</p>
<p>Fiber is crucial - strive for 30+ grams a day
</p>
<p>Avoid refined sugars (see below) and try to eat tubers instead of grains when possible.
</p>
<p>Sources of carbohydrate  include
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables">Roots and tubers</a> ( potatoes, yams, beets, parsnips, turnips, etc.) </li>
	<li>Squashes (pumpkin, butternut, acorn, spaghetti, etc.)</li>
	<li>Fruits ( always eat the whole fruit, avoid just fruit juice); e.g. oranges, blueberries, strawberries, apples, grapes, pears, bananas, avocados, etc.</li>
	<li>Greens (collards, kale, mustard, chard, beets, dandelion, lettuce, etc.)</li>
	<li>All other<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables"> vegetables </a>(e.g.,  broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, okra, onions, peppers, tomatoes, Brussel sprouts,etc.)  Also mushrooms.</li>
	<li>Beans and peanuts are “vegetables,” but technically legumes. They contain carbs and proteins. Eat them according to your preference.  Vegans will likely eat more beans than omnivores.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<p>Corn is not a vegetable, it is a grain like wheat or rice. (see below)
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1>Fats</h1></li>
</ul>
<p>Eat quality fats in reasonable / adequate quantities.
</p>
<p>&lt;= 30% of daily calories from fat is a good goal.
</p>
<p>If you are calorie restricting, be alert to extra calories from fat “hiding” in “complex” prepared foods,  like sauces, casseroles or lasagna.  Go ahead and eat it, just try to be aware of it and its quantity/quality.
</p>
<p>Sources of fat, in no particular order, include
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Butter - try for grass-fed butter (e.g., Kerrygold)</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
	<li>Coconut oil</li>
	<li>Fish oils (ideally in fish, not capsules)</li>
	<li>Flax oil (as oil, or in flax seeds/ meal)</li>
	<li>Peanut butter</li>
	<li>Nuts generally ( also a source of some protein and carbs)</li>
	<li>Seeds, like chia, pumpkin, sesame, etc</li>
	<li>Seed and other oils (corn, grapeseed, avocado, hemp, pumpkin, etc)</li>
	<li>Algae-based essential fats (not a good source of calories</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimize/limit consumption of purified seed-based oils, such as sunflower, grapeseed, soybean, corn oil, etc.  as your primary fat sources.  These aren’t bad per se, they just aren’t as good as olive oil, fish oil, etc.
</p>
<p>If you only ever ate olive oil, avocados and grass-fed butter as fat, with occasional cold-water fish for dinner, you’d be doing very well.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1>Other Foods</h1></li>
</ul>
<p>Look to reduce and limit consumption of the following foods.
</p>
<p>“Reduce and limit” means it’s not a problem at all to eat them, nor should they be feared, just don’t rely on them exclusively for your daily calories or make them a standard part of your daily meals.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grain-based foods, like rice, bread, pasta, crackers
	<ul>
		<li>These aren’t bad at all, they are for the most part just calories.  More nutrient-dense choices will help with weight control.</li>
		<li>If you are maintaining weight, rather than deliberately losing fat, you can get away with eating more of these.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Processed or pre-prepared foods</li>
	<li>Heavily salted, sauced or battered foods (chicken fingers, nuggets, pizza pockets)</li>
	<li>Cheese (cheese is amazing, but use it as a treat, not a staple)</li>
	<li>Flavored /sweetened yogurts  (mostly refined sugar)</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid or use as a special treat  [will trigger your reward systems and make it easy to overeat]
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fruit juices</li>
	<li>Candy</li>
	<li>chocolate</li>
	<li>Ice cream</li>
	<li>Sugar water (Gatorade, lemonade, sweet teas, soda, etc.)</li>
	<li>Baked goods/Desserts in general </li>
	<li>Foods with lots of added sugar or salt</li>
	<li>Processed carbs ( e.g. french fries, chips, tater tots)</li>
	<li>Ultra-processed foods generally (see, eg., <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1949">here,</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1451">here </a>and especially<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7"> here</a>)</li>
	<li>Artificial sweeteners</li>
</ul>
<h1>NEVER CONSUME</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Trans fats ( partially or fully hydrogenated oils)</li>
	<li>Diet drugs or laxatives.</li>
	<li>Alcohol  (a toxin and prioritized fuel for your brain, in addition to being illegal for high school students)</li>
	<li>A mystery supplement your buddy says “is awesome” or will “get you totally ripped”.</li>
</ul>
<p>AND GET ENOUGH SLEEP!
